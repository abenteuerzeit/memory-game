# Memory Game

## Introduction

Welcome to my memory game! This game is a simple matching game where the player must reveal pairs of matching letters on a grid. The game has four difficulty levels or the option to create a custom board size.

## Requirements
This game requires Python 3 to run.

## Running the game
To start the game, simply run the script memory_game.py in your terminal.

Follow the prompts to select a difficulty level or create a custom board. Then, select the positions of the letters you want to reveal by inputting the coordinates (e.g. "B2"). The game will continue until all pairs have been found or the player quits.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any errors or bugs while running the game, please open an issue on the repository or contact the developer for assistance.
